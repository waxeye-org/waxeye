User Manual
===========

Waxeye's user manual is in 'docs/manual.html'. The latest version is also
online at http://waxeye.org/manual.html.


Installation
============

Unix, OSX:
1. Extract the files of the distribution.

2. Copy the 'waxeye' directory to where you wish to install it.

3. Add the 'bin/waxeye' binary to your search path. e.g. If you have '~/bin' in
   your PATH and installed waxeye to '/usr/local/waxeye' then you might do the
   following. ln -s /usr/local/waxeye/bin/waxeye ~/bin/


Windows:
1. Extract the files of the distribution.

2. Copy the 'waxeye' directory to where you wish to install it.


Building
========

1. Install MzScheme v4; either with DrScheme or alone.
   http://download.plt-scheme.org

2. Install Waxeye's backend for PLT Scheme.
   Unix, OSX:
   sudo ln -s /usr/local/waxeye/src/scheme/waxeye /usr/local/plt/lib/plt/collects/

   Windows:
   Copy the directory 'src/scheme/waxeye' into your PLT-Scheme 'collects'
   directory. For example, that might be 'C:\Program Files\PLT\collects'.

3. Build Waxeye
   Unix, OSX:
   ./build/unix

   Windows:

   - If your PLT-Scheme installation isn't 'C:\Program Files\PLT' then you will
   need to modify 'build\exe.bat' to use the correct path.

   - From your Waxeye installation directory, run the 'build\exe.bat' script in a
   command prompt.

   - When the script has finished, press 'y' then 'Enter' to remove the
   temporary files.


Running
=======

Unix, OSX:
Use 'waxeye'.

Windows:
Use a command prompt to run `waxeye.exe`. Note: If using the interpreter under
Windows, you will need to press 'Ctrl-z' and then 'Enter' after the input you
want to interpret.
